    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <div class="grid_8 alpha">
      <p>M*Modal’s dictation software captures structured data from physicians’ speech as they dictate patient data. Our objective is to improve the quality of physicians’ documentation by providing access to this data and by helping them to catch errors. In January 2012, our team began researching how physicians interact with their Electronic Medical Record (EMR) software by interviewing physicians and observing them at work. In May, we presented our research findings and recommendations for possible design solutions to pursue during the second phase of the project.</p>
      <p>Physicians communicate with patients to gather this data and provide care <em>(1)</em>. They then input that data into their Electronic Medical Record system <em>(2)</em>. These patient records are also used by billing departments, whose needs differ from those of physicians <em>(3)</em>. Our research sought to identify <strong>potential interventions</strong> during the second step to help physicians capture data that satisfies their own goals as well as those of the billing department.</p>

    <h2>About M*Modal</h2>
    <div class="grid_8 push_4 alpha">
      <p>M*Modal provides speech understanding software to hospitals that extracts structured data from patient notes dictated in prose. Using their software, physicians dictate their impressions into a microphone and the computer parses data such as chief complaints and vital signs from the prose spoken by the doctor. Extracting structured data allows physicians and other medical professionals to view that data in a variety of ways—such as in tables or plots—without having to read through an entire report.<p>

      <p>M*Modal’s products integrate with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems like Epic and AllScripts, allowing physicians to use dictation with their existing tools.</p>
